          <h4>Est 2013</h4>
          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>Working in a senior role in manufacturing, I was looking for a simple solution to track maintenance work. We kept forgetting about preventative maintenance, due to breakdowns and changing priorities. A typical scenario for many companies!</p>
          <p>The market seemed full of complex and expensive solutions that were over the top for an SME. After failing to find a solution, I set about building a simple application. The tool we built was fast, reliable and easy to follow. It could be accessed from the office, home or working abroad.</p>
          <p>I have always been a fan of cloud software - I was running sites in 3 countries so access and mobility was a priority. When I was living in Dubai the idea to commercialise the product hit me. It would be ideal for so many other small companies like us.</p>
          <p>Smartspanner was founded in 2013 and developed the initial tool as a cloud hosted platform, with SMEs in mind. Its first customer was early 2015. It has never stopped growing since. We listen to our clients and learnt what features our market wanted in the software.</p>
          <p>The business has grown from a few regional customers to having customers across 4 continents. Our customers range from small companies with single users to large PLCs, and work in a variety of industries.</p>
          <p>In 2023 the company experienced significant growth and also pressure to develop the system. At the end of 2023 we released a brand new mobile app. In 2024 a roadmap evolved that would transform Smartspanner from a small business solution to an enterprise level CMMS. In addition 2024 will also open up IOT vibration monitoring as a solution offered by Smartspanner, either as a stand alone solution, or integrating into Smartspanner CMMS.</p>
