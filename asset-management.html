          Asset management is all about maintaining equipment, machinery and plant. It could be at a factory, depot, restaurant, farm, or even a mine. Keeping assets up and running is essential to maintenance, but it isn't about putting out fires all the time. Asset management includes preventative maintenance, breakdowns, faults, inspections and in many cases compliance activities have to be scheduled and documented with an audit trail.
