<p>
  The core functions of CMMS applications are essentially all the same. The market has many different options to choose from and these vary in features and complexity. Finding the right choice for your needs can be a challenge with endless feature lists, different prices and of course some really good sales pitches to get you interested. To start with we will consider two cases:
</p>

<h5>1. Already have a CMMS application and want to change</h5>
<p>
  If you are in this category then you have some experience of CMMS and will know what isn't working out with your current system. Typically we find its because the system is too complex. This means employees are not sure how to use it, can't effect positive change and over time interest declines. Eventually it becomes a burden rather than a tool to the organisation. It could also be that you need something more advanced with higher level maintenance features or integrations with other business tools.
</p>

<h5>2. First implementation of a CMMS system.</h5>
<p>
  When making a new implementation it is important to know what your problems are on the ground. You should have a clear view of what the real benefits you want gain are and then focus on this core requirement when selecting a CMMS system. It is always advisable to get a team decision on the choice of vendor. The more your team are part of the process, the more successful you will be. Here are points to consider when selection your CMMS vendor:
</p>

<h5>Price</h5>
<p>
  The price is of course an important factor and should be appropriate to your needs and the scale of the business. Don't get carried away with getting the most number of features possible because this can often mean you are getting an more complicated system that you need.
</p>

<h5>Downsides of Cloud Software</h5>
<ul>
  <li>As business needs change or better alternatives appeal to the business for change, migration of data from one system to another can be complex and impractical.</li>
  <li>In the long term it may prove to be more expensive to pay a subscription, but it is unlikely considering the benefits, to be a significant factor assuming some software expenditure is required.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cloud or On Premise</h5>
<p>
  Many CMMS systems are cloud hosted and for small to medium sizes companies and multi-site, this enables fast deployment. Secure and reliable cloud technologies means there is no need for IT support, installation and backup. In general we would say that only a large company with its own IT department should consider on-premise systems.
</p>

<h5>Features</h5>
<p>
  The features have to match your needs as a business and this is a case by case analysis of your needs against the functionality of the application.
</p>

<h5>Ease of Use</h5>
<p>
  Your maintenance team will have to use the application every day and their support for the implementation is vital. It is important to consider their IT skills and ease of use of the application to get the most of the software.
</p>

<h5>Mobility</h5>
<p>
  If you run multi-site businesses or large sites, having mobile applications can be a real benefit. Keeping everyone connected and working effectively in real time can be a game changer.
